# auto-text-summarization
The tool that I have developed to generate summary of large documents based on various algorithms and English Language techniques. The summary that tools generates is a shortened version of the original or it is the restating of the main ideas of the text in as few words as possible. The main purpose of such a simplification is to highlight the major points out of original (much longer) document.
